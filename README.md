# FACExplainer
This is the official implement of Paper [FACExplainer: Generating Model-faithful Explanations for Graph Neural Networks Guided by Spatial Information of the Target Model]

## Prerequisites
```shell script
$ cd ./FACExplainer
$ source install.sh
``` 

For Graph_SST2 dataset, it is too big to upload. We suggest to download Graph_SST2 from its source code or any exsiting work that has it (we recommend DIG).

## Usage
For experiment in the paper, please see `run_explainers.sh`




### Remark
Our baseline code is heavily based on the DIG library with small changes. We summarize the difference in `difference_from_dig.md`

### Reference
The `gnn_explainer`, `pgexplainer`, and `subgraphx` implementations are based on the DIG library.

The `gstarx` implementaiton is based on the official Gstarx code.

The `orphicx` implementaiton is based on the official OrphicX code, where datasets processing and GNNs are changed to align with DIG.
